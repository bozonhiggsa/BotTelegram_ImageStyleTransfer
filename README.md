### Bot Telegram for Image Style Transfer
##### Implementation of Image Style Transfer with the use of pretrained model from TensorFlow Hub magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2

Imlementation is based on the original work for artistic style transfer with neural networks proposed a slow optimization algorithm that works on any arbitrary painting.

Technologies:
- Python 3;
- TensorFlow 2.

#### Prerequisites
You need to install packages to project's environment:
- telebot;
- urllib.request;
- Pillow;
- numpy;
- tensorflow;
- tensorflow_hub.

You need to go to @BotFather (inside Telegram), create new bot and get your own unique token.
